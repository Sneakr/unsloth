// A drag needs one cursor over the whole viewport, because the pointer travels across buttons and
// text that would otherwise claim their own. That used to be `html[data-panel-resizing] *` plus
// `cursor`/`user-select` on <body>. Both reach every element in the document: the universal
// selector matches all of them, and `cursor` and `user-select` are inherited, so writing them on
// <body> marks inherited style dirty for everything below it. The cost is therefore proportional to
// the STANDING DOM rather than to the one thing that changed, which is the same shape as the
// sidebar-width writes scoped in #9400/#9441. The same is true of the rule that blanked pointer
// events on the sidebar and on [data-slot="sidebar-inset"], the <main> holding the whole app
// including the thread: `pointer-events` is inherited too, so that write dirtied the thread's
// subtree on both flips as well. A single fixed element on top of the viewport does both jobs with
// an invalidation set of one element. It carries the cursor, and by being the hit test target for
// the whole viewport it keeps hover and click off the content underneath. It is transparent and it
// is removed the instant the drag ends, so nothing about what the user sees changes.
