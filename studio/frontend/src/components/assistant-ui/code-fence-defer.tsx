 * MONOTONIC fence highlighting: a fence renders as a plain shell until the first time it comes near
 * the viewport, and is highlighted for the rest of its mount. There is no reverse edge.
 * An earlier attempt gated on viewport entry AND exit, so scrolling away tore the highlighted
 * subtree down and scrolling back rebuilt it: a gesture that ought to cost nothing scheduled a full
 * re-tokenize, and it measured slower. Here the only transition is cheap -> expensive, at most once
 * per mount, so the worst case is exactly today's cost and every fence never reached is saved.
 * The shell is the same text in the same elements streamdown's own unhighlighted fallback would
 * use, carrying the same `data-streamdown` attributes so index.css sizes it unchanged. The text is
 * in the DOM and selectable, which `content-visibility: auto` is not (skipped content has to be
 * rendered before it can be selected, +28.8% on select_all_ms).
 * A STREAMING fence never defers: the block being written is the one the reader is looking at.

 * Observer 2.2 resolves percentages against the undilated rectangle's WIDTH for all four sides, no

 * the height on Chromium, Firefox and WebKit alike, which `inBand` and the jump test both assume.

 * Why the poke and the nesting, since an empty `flushSync(() => {})` does neither: React runs
 * pending passive effects from `performSyncWorkOnRoot`, reached only when sync work is waiting, and
 * `poke` is that work. And `flushSync` restores update priority BEFORE performing the flush, so the

 * BOTH DOORS: `beforeprint` covers Ctrl+P and the print menu; headless `page.pdf()` and DevTools
 * print emulation change the media query without firing it.
 * A PRINT UPGRADES THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PRINTED, AND NOTHING ELSE. This was a module-global
 * `printed` folded into every future fence's `reached`, so one Ctrl+P turned the default off for
 * the tab's life, including threads never on the printed page. So a print latches what is on the
 * page WHEN IT HAPPENS and a fence mounted afterwards defers again. Still one way only: reverting

 * GRAMMARS, WARMED AT IDLE, ON REAL TEXT, ONE TOKENIZATION PER TASK.

 * grammar: on a jump into a language the reader has not met, and on a print, where there is no
 * later frame to correct in. Nothing runs when nothing is deferred. "Per language" means per
 * GRAMMAR, `normalizeLanguage`, not per fence tag: ```py and ```python are one grammar, and two
 * keys here would warm it twice on two different fences.
 * IT USED TO WARM ON AN EMPTY STRING. Loading a grammar is the cheap half; running it over text the
 * first time is not, and `""` never does the second, so the first REAL tokenization still paid the
 * whole one-off cost, landing in one frame during a scroll (worst scroll frame 1200 ms against
 * 185 ms warming on real text, three arms out of one build). Moved, not skipped: total tokenize
 * time RISES, because a warmed fence is tokenized once and read from cache later.
 * WHY THE TOKENIZATIONS YIELD AND THE LOADS DO NOT. An idle callback only chooses when it STARTS:
 * nothing yields once it runs, its 2,000 ms timeout can start it on a busy thread, and WebKitGTK
 * has no `requestIdleCallback` at all. With a grammar already loaded `code.highlight` tokenizes
 * INLINE and N languages concatenate. But `highlight` answers `null` WHILE a grammar loads, so
 * yielding the loads too would put the fifth grammar 500 ms x N away and a jump or print inside
 * that window would get the plain fallback out of `latchNow`'s flush, the defect this pre-warm
 * exists to prevent. So every load starts in the first pass and only the tokenizing is spread out.
 * NOTHING BOUNDED THE SIZE OF A WARM, and this comment used to claim `MAX_HIGHLIGHT_CHARS` did. It
 * does not reach here: `markdown-text.tsx` supplies the code plugin unconditionally, `FenceBlock`
 * warms the whole body, and `code-plugin.ts`'s `evict` keeps the last fence whatever its size. A
 * LATCH is demanded work and stays uncapped; a warm is SPECULATIVE, so it is capped at the same
 * 20,000 characters. Over the cap, and for a fence that is empty or nothing but newlines, the
 * grammar loads and nothing is tokenized; neither marks the language warmed, so a later fence that
 * can warm it still does.

 * THE OUTERMOST ONE TOO, and why the nearest is not enough on its own.
 * An explicit root is clipped by the ancestors BETWEEN the target and the root, and by NOTHING
 * above it, so rooting at the reasoning pane asks "is this fence inside the pane's window" and
 * never "is the pane anywhere near the reader". A pane scrolled far out of the thread still reports
 * the fences inside its 256 px window as intersecting, and `reasoning.tsx` drops `max-h-64` when
 * the stream ends but KEEPS `overflow-y-auto`, so the pane stops being scrollable, its box becomes
 * the whole trace, and an observer still rooted at it reports EVERY fence at once.
 * Rooting at the outermost scroller instead would fix both and cost the lookahead the nearest one
 * bought (5 of 10 inner against 3 of 10 outer, measured). So when the two differ there are two
 * gates and the latch needs both: the FENCE against the nearest scroller answers "the reader is
 * about to reach it inside the pane", and the PANE against the outermost answers "the pane is
 * somewhere the reader can see". Watching the fence through the outer root instead would clip it at
 * the pane on the way and go false exactly where the inner lookahead works. When the two scrollers
 * are the same element there is one observer and this costs nothing.
 * THE CONJUNCTION IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. A stale inner root is too permissive and the outer gate
 * only covers that while the pane is out of view: scroll the expanded pane partly on screen and the
 * stale inner root decides alone and reports the WHOLE trace (10 of 10 in both engines where the
 * right answer is about 3). So the inner root is re-resolved when the pane stops scrolling, which
 * collapses the fence back to the single-gate case.
 * Watched with a ResizeObserver on the pane rather than by re-resolving every frame, and only for
 * fences that have a nested scroller: the callback reads one `overflow-y` on one element.
 * Still one-way. The extra gate and the rebind can only withhold a latch.
